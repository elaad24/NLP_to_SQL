# **AI-Driven SQL Query Generator & Execution System**

This project implements an **AI-driven reasoning system** that:

- Breaks down **complex business questions** into structured **reasoning steps**.
- Generates **optimized SQL queries** for each reasoning step.
- Executes queries **sequentially or in parallel** based on dependencies.
- Uses **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** to **combine multiple queries** into a **single efficient SQL query**.
- Implements **caching and optimization techniques** to improve performance.

## **üöÄ Features**

‚úî **AI-Powered SQL Generation** ‚Äì Uses LLM (Large Language Model) to convert human queries into optimized SQL.  
‚úî **Automated Query Execution** ‚Äì Executes queries in **parallel** where possible, reducing execution time.  
‚úî **Dependency Resolution** ‚Äì Handles queries with **cross-step dependencies** dynamically.  
‚úî **CTE-Based Query Merging** ‚Äì Combines multiple SQL queries into a **single CTE-based query**.  
‚úî **Caching System** ‚Äì Stores query results in **memory** to avoid redundant executions.  
‚úî **Error Handling & Self-Reflection** ‚Äì Ensures query correctness through AI **self-reflection mechanisms**.

## **üß† How It Works**

### **Step 1: AI Generates SQL Queries**

- The LLM receives a **natural language question**.
- It **breaks it down** into multiple **reasoning steps**.
- It generates **SQL queries** for each step.
- Each step is **labeled with dependencies** (`depends_on_previous: true/false`).

#### **Example LLM Response:**

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "chain_of_thought": "We need to find the highest revenue customer segment.",
      "sub_question": "What is the total revenue for each customer segment?",
      "depends_on_previous": false,
      "sql_query": "SELECT segment, SUM(Orders.quantity * Products.price) AS revenue FROM Customers JOIN Orders ON Customers.id = Orders.user_id JOIN Products ON Orders.product_id = Products.id GROUP BY segment ORDER BY revenue DESC;"
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "chain_of_thought": "Now, we need to check revenue trends over time for the top segment.",
      "sub_question": "How has the revenue for the top customer segment changed over time?",
      "depends_on_previous": true,
      "sql_query": "SELECT Orders.order_date, SUM(Orders.quantity * Products.price) AS revenue FROM Orders JOIN Customers ON Orders.user_id = Customers.id JOIN Products ON Orders.product_id = Products.id WHERE Customers.segment = {previous_result} GROUP BY Orders.order_date ORDER BY Orders.order_date ASC;"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### **Step 2: Query Execution**

- Independent queries (`depends_on_previous: false`) run **in parallel**.
- Dependent queries (`depends_on_previous: true`) **wait for previous results** before execution.
- Results are **stored in cache** for fast retrieval.

#### **Code Example:**

```typescript
const executeSQLQueries = async (steps: ReasoningStep[]) => {
  const results: Record<number, any> = {};

  for (const step of steps) {
    let query = step.sql_query || "";

    if (step.depends_on_previous) {
      const previousStep = steps[step.step - 2]; // Get the previous step
      const previousResult = results[previousStep.step];
      query = query.replace("{previous_result}", previousResult);
    }

    const result = await runSQLQuery(query);
    results[step.step] = result;
  }

  return results;
};
```

---

### **Step 3: Merging SQL Queries with CTEs**

- Instead of running multiple separate queries, we **merge them into a single query using CTEs**.
- This **improves performance** and **reduces query execution time**.

#### **Merged SQL Query Example:**

```sql
WITH
Step1 AS (
    SELECT segment, SUM(Orders.quantity * Products.price) AS revenue
    FROM Customers
    JOIN Orders ON Customers.id = Orders.user_id
    JOIN Products ON Orders.product_id = Products.id
    GROUP BY segment
    ORDER BY revenue DESC
),
Step2 AS (
    SELECT Orders.order_date, SUM(Orders.quantity * Products.price) AS revenue
    FROM Orders
    JOIN Customers ON Orders.user_id = Customers.id
    JOIN Products ON Orders.product_id = Products.id
    WHERE Customers.segment = (SELECT segment FROM Step1 LIMIT 1)
    GROUP BY Orders.order_date
    ORDER BY Orders.order_date ASC
)
SELECT * FROM Step2;
```

#### **How It Works:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ `Step1` finds the **top revenue customer segment**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ `Step2` **analyzes revenue trends** for that segment.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ The **final `SELECT * FROM Step2;`** retrieves the insights.
